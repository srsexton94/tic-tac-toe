Tic Tac Toe planning

1. Draw the lines
  a. console.log the board
  b. us an array with 9 elements to represent the board
    i. can be one dimensional or two dimensional
  c. our array will have nine null values to start (if 1 dimensional)
2. Choose X's or O's
  a. Player 1 will be X and Player 2 will be O
3. X's go first
  a. use a "turn" variable to store whose turn it is ("X" or "O")
4. X chooses a spot
  a. replace null value with "turn" variable
5. Change the turn
  a. update the "turn" variable to be the opposite of what it currently is
6. O chooses a spot
  a. make sure spot is available (if it has a null value)
  b. replace null value with "turn" variable
7. repeat until the game ends
  a. while loop
8. Check if someone gets three in a row, they are the winner
  a. this should take place at the end of each turn
  b. we will need index numbers of the positions we are checking
  c. if statement used to introduce branching
9. It's a tie if there are no more playable spots and no winner
  a. this should take place at the end of each turn
  b. no more null values and none of the checks from step 8 were true
10. Repeat the whole process to play again
